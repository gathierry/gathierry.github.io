_Abstract_  
This report is basically a summary for the paper _A Survey on Deep Learning in Medical Image Analysis_ [Litjens et al.] to introduce some deep learning techniques in medical image analysis. For more details, please refer to the original paper.

## Introduction
The referenced paper is a survey on deep learning applied to medical image analysis including over 300 papers before February 1st, 2017 from PubMed, ArXiv and conferences such as MICCAI, SPIE, ISBI and EMBC. Papers that didn't report results on medical image data or only used standard feed-forward neural networks with handcrafted features are excluded. Figures below shows the distributions of model used, task addressed, imaging modality and anatomical application area in this survey.
